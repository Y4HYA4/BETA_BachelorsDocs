# ðŸ’¡About This Project

I was and still am the type of student who learned most things online; it was always my preferred method of acquiring knowledge and passing exams. This is where the idea for this project arose. Everything is obviously available on the internet; it's just a matter of searching. So my goal is to gather as much valuable information as possible so that you can complete your degree from your PC.

I'm aware that Tunisian ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡³ education is in French, but I wanted to make sure that all of the materials here are in English to get you closer to the market, as you won't need much of French. I'll be providing materials of that language as well.
