# Beta Documentation 

> Documenting the path i took for students aiming to pick the same education. 

This theme serves as the starting point for the documentation. I had an idea for a new UI with a dark/white mode experience while interacting on it.


# Contribution
## Improve this project
Possibly more than ever before, I will require contributions. I'll keep adding useful content and asking classmates, teachers, and anyone else who can help to get this project to a point where you only need your machine to finish your degree.

As the project progresses, I'll include a HOW-TO contribution.
